# Medocker 0.1.0 for Windows

## Quick Start

Run the main executable:

```
./medocker.exe
```

This will automatically launch the web interface, which is the primary way to interact with Medocker.

You can also run specific commands if needed:

```
./medocker.exe --help            # Show help
./medocker.exe configure         # Configure the Medocker stack
./medocker.exe web               # Start the web interface
./medocker.exe deploy            # Deploy the Docker stack
```

For convenience, you can also use the launcher script:
```
./launcher.bat
```
