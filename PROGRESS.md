# Medocker Development Progress

## Implemented Features

- âœ… Basic Medocker configuration UI
- âœ… Service deployment configuration
- âœ… User setup with Ansible
- âœ… Windows compatibility through custom implementations

## In Progress Features

- ðŸ”„ Service Cart UI for easy service selection
  - Basic UI structure created
  - Service catalog JSON created
  - API endpoints added to handle cart operations
  - Need to add more specialty stacks and service options
  - Need to improve service catalog with more detailed information

- ðŸ”„ AI Services Integration
  - Basic structure for AI services added to cart
  - Need to implement configuration for AI API keys
  - Need to implement local AI model deployment configuration

## Planned Features

- ðŸ“‹ Service Marketplace
  - Allow community contributions of services
  - Add rating and review system
  - Implement verification and approval process

- ðŸ“‹ Dependency Management
  - Automatically detect and resolve service dependencies
  - Warn about incompatible services or version conflicts

- ðŸ“‹ System Requirements Calculation
  - More accurate estimation of hardware requirements
  - Performance optimization recommendations

- ðŸ“‹ Deployment Testing
  - Automated testing of service configurations
  - Health checks for deployed services

## Known Issues

- The Windows implementation of ansible-runner is simplified and may not support all features
- Service catalog needs expansion with more specialty-specific services
- User experience for the cart feature needs refinement
- AI service deployment needs further implementation details

## Next Steps

1. Enhance the Service Cart with dynamic loading of services from the catalog
2. Implement the checkout process fully with diff/merge summaries
3. Add API key management for AI services
4. Develop the specialty stacks in more detail with better organization
